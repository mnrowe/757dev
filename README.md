# Design

Using this as inspiration [bootstrap-agency](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-agency/). If anyone has better idea for design I'm open to it.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
